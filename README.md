# Echo
using MATLAB code to change the recorded voice, in purpose of creating an echo.
the main idea is a for-like loop in which we pick a channel, and then choose a row of data in signal samples, and sum it up with previous rows to create a set of data in our new variable, b_echo.
you can change the "audioread" path to your desired auido file, to work with this program.
